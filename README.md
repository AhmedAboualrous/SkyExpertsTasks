Image Filtering and Sizing using OpenCV
This code demonstrates how to perform image filtering and sizing using OpenCV in Python. The code reads an existing image in grayscale format, converts it to colored BGR format, applies a Gaussian blur filter, and then applies a sharpening filter to the blurred image. Finally, it displays the original, smoothed, and sharpened images side by side.

Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV
NumPy
Matplotlib

Usage
Clone this repository.
Install the required packages using pip: pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib.
Replace blurred_image.jpg with your own image file.
Run the script: python image_filtering.py.
The original, smoothed, and sharpened images will be displayed side by side.
